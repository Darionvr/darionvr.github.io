## My process



### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow



### What I learned

What definitely gave me trouble was arranging the cards in a cascading order because they didnâ€™t respect the block space and overlapped with other elements. To solve it, I added a margin only to the center card and kept all of them using the flex and align-self properties.
