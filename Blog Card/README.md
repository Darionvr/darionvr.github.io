## Overview

In this challenge, I tried using Figma for the first time, and it was really fun to get into the details of padding and margin.

## My process

I started making the card as the -main- landmark taking care of the measures given by the Figma file, it was my first time using that program. It helped me when I had to create the text box below the image because every line have diferent style so I was no 100% sure on how to proceed but the Figma fila y very specific on what to do.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- Figma


### What I learned

This time I use typs given by other user's feedbacks on my previuos challenge.
I use -grid- to center the card. And replace the -p- landmarks by H1, h2, etc.
Also didn't make a mediaquery, instead I use min and max width.
