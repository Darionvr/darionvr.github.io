## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learned to create shapes and work with empty boxes just by adding colors and sizes to them.

### Continued development



### Useful resources

- [Triangle shape video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbxZhLHYN44&ab_channel=CodingArtist) - This helped me making the triangle shape.


## Acknowledgments

I used grid columns to give a fixed and proportional size to the different boxes in desktop mode,  This way, the boxes fill the space to the size I need, avoiding the need to specify widths.

Also, for the triangle shape on the "185Gb left" box I use the ::after pseudo class.
