## My process

For this challenge, I didnâ€™t use the JSON file that was provided and instead used a full CSS table. I found this challenge very tricky due to details like the rounded corners on the blue card and the shadow on the entire summary, creating that layered effect

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid



### What I learned

I learned how to make a circle div with some text inside of it, and it was the first time styling a table.It was a little difficult to put everything in order in my css file trying not to create an inifinite amount of code. 



### Continued development

I need to keep learning how to styling tables, I wasn't able to put a gap between each row and create the round corners. I tried using border-radius and gap but they had no effect on the table.
