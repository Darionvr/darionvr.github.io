## My process

For this challenge I didn't use the Json file that was provided and use a full css table instead. I found this challenge very tricky because of some details like de rounded corners on the blue card and the shadow on the whole summary making that layers effect. 

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid



### What I learned

I learned how to make a circle div with some text inside of it and it was the first time styling a table, it was a little difficult to put everything in order on my css file trying no to make an inifinite code. 



### Continued development

I need to keep learning how to styling tables, I wasn't able to put the gap between each row and the round corners. I tried putting round-border and gap but these make no effect on a table.
